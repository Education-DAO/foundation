# Gitcoin Analysis

## Initiative Description
Gitcoin rounds provide an extraordinarily rich set of public data on how a large group of people can fund public goods.  We are analyzing the patterns of donations to the projects listed on Gitcoin and matching them against production functions.  This can give us insights into how users donation behaviors and what frameworks we should layer on top of a Gitcoin round to encourage sustained public good funding.
