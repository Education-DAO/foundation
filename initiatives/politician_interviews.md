# Politician Interviews

## Initiative Description
We are reaching out to politicians and conducting user interviews with them to undersand how they could decentralize their campaigns and/or governing teams.  The goal is to understand what are the barriers, benefits, and potential downsides of decentralizing politics and government.  We want to apply these learnings to the DAO tools we're building so enable politicians, elected officials, and activits to use our tools and DAOs for governing.
