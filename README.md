# Foundation
Govrn believe in the open source movement.  We believe in transparency.  We believe that the community is stronger than the individual.

We want to clearly state the principles we believe in, and the principles we reject.  This repo shows just that and allows our community to fully see, understand, and contribute to it as well.

This is meant to be a living document that anyone can add to or change.  We aren't defined by the institution, but rather our movement members define the instution.  Anyone can add to this repo, or fork of it and make a better version.

We are here for you, not the other way around.

This means the main question is, what do you want to be defined by.
